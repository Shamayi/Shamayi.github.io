        <h2>Analysis of Ecological Aesthetics Thought</h2>
       <li>In the film, Na'i, as the intelligent creature of Pandora, they reverence nature and conform to the laws of nature, which is a perfect interpretation of the aesthetic proposition of "poetic habitation" proposed by Heidegger. </li>
       <li>Nami is in awe of nature, regards herself and other creatures as equal creatures in nature, and follows the natural will and balance of Eva ——, the god of nature. Their attitude towards nature and the equal mode of coexistence with nature are the presentation of the "complex charm" picture advocated by ecological aesthetics.</li>

        <h2>Rebellion against anthropocentrism</h2>
       <li>The collapse of the human beings in the film is the recognition of respecting all things and knowing how to live in harmony with nature, the generous praise of the beauty, and also the deconstruction of human-centrism and the worship of ecological-centrism. </li>
       <li>In the film, human beings paid a painful price for their greed and contempt for ecology, and finally were forced to return to the desolate earth, while the vigilant human representatives were fully integrated into the alien civilization with respect for nature. On the one hand, this shows the film creators' resistance to anthropocentrism, and also shows their good expectations for human beings to go back to nature</li>

<h2>Film aesthetic analysis</h2>
<ol>
<li>Comparison with traditional films Compared with traditional films, "Avatar" can be said to completely break the consistent aesthetic style of traditional films.In the characters, scenes and other modeling design, there is basically no human image, but a kind of heterogeneous biological image design between people and animals. There is a feeling of "time travel" and "rebirth", but also because of the limitations of science and technology mentioned in the film, people can't help but produce a "natural" evaluation.</li>
<li>Comparison with animation films As is known to all, animation films are completely virtual world structure, generally animation are based on the principle of aestheticism, the use of computer to show aesthetic elements, more attention to the picture effect.But this film has a considerable sense of stereo and reality. In the details of more in place, even the hair design is quite real</li>
